# FastRCReader
A fast and lightweight library to read PWM RC signals from a RC RX (Receiver)

## Added changes
- Added lastTimeIntus() function to the class FastRCReader to know when is occurred the last interrupt (last time interrupt in microseconds). For example, there is an RC receiver that stops emitting the PWM when the radio is disconnected, so a failsafe mode can be activated if more than X us passes without receiving an interruption.
- Added isRecvOn() and recvTimeout() function to the class RCChannelMapper to kown if the radio is on or off based on last interrupt establishing a timeout when is received the last interrupt. The default timeout value is 20000 us.

## Compatibility
Currently FastRCReader is only compatible with ATmega328P (Arduino UNO & NANO) and ATmega168 (Arduino NANO)

FastRCReader uses ISR (Interrupts). Do not use interrupts in your code or you will get an error somewhere.
Don't create a variable, object or struct with the name _channel, it is globally used by the FastRCReader after you included the library.

## How to use FastRCReader
At the beginning, create a global Object for the FastRCReader:

    FastRCReader RC;

To initalize the RC, start the RC in the setup() function:

    RC.begin();

To add a Channel for your RC, use:

    RC.addChannel(uint8_t Channel);
    
If you don't know what an uint8_t is, it is basically a half unsigned int.

To delete a Channel, use:

    RC.stopChannel(uint8_t Channel);

To add more than one Channel at once, you can add or stop an array of Channels:

    RC.addChannel(uint8_t Channels[]);
    RC.addChannel(uint8_t Channels[], uint8_t ChannelAmount);
    
    RC.stopChannel(uint8_t Channels[]);
    RC.stopChannel(uint8_t Channels[], uint8_t ChannelAmount);

To get the Frequency of a given Channel, use:

    RC.getFreq(uint8_t Channel);
    //Returns an unsigned int (uint16_t)

To define the ports you want to use, have a look in the FastRCReader.h. In the FastRCReader.h, use one of the following definitions (also described in there). You can also #define the PORTS_TO_USE before the #include in your own sketch to specify the Ports to use. At the moment, you can only use one of the port-ranges at a time:

    Pick one of the following at "PORTS_TO_USE"
    Use 1 to use Port D8 - D13
    Use 2 to use Port A0 - A5
    Use 3 to use Port D0 - D7

The Channels are directly mapped to the Pins of the Arduino:

    D0 = Channel 0
    D1 = Channel 1
    ...
    D7 = Channel 7
    
    D8 = Channel 0
    D9 = Channel 1
    ...
    D13 = Channel 5
    
    A0 = Channel 0
    A1 = Channel 1
    ...
    A5 = Channel 5

## How to use RCChannelMapper
RCChannelMapper is a child of FastRCReader, so you can use all commands described above. You can NOT use RCChannelMapper and FastRCReader at the same time! Only create one of both instances, RCChannelMapper does the same but more.

At the beginning, create a global Object for the RCChannelMapper:

    RCChannelMapper RC;

To initialize the RC, start the RC in the setup() function:

    RC.begin();

Add Channel & Delete Channel see above!

To set the Mapping, use:

    RC.setMap(uint16_t minChannelState, uint16_t maxChannelState, uint8_t Channel, float toMin = -1, float toMax = 1);

To get the mapped value of a Channel, use:

    RC.getChannel(uint8_t Channel);
    //Returns a float

## Pre-Calibration
If you want to pre-calibrate your RC before using with your own code, just use the Calibration_Mapping_to_EEPROM example. Just change the CHANNELAMOUNT definition and channelPins variable to your own needs. After calibrating your RC, the calibration will be saved in the EEPROM. Just add the following lines of code to your sketch to load it back again:

    #include <FastRCReader.h>
    #include <EEPROM.h>
    
    RCChannelMapper RC;
    #define EEPROMADRESS 0
    
    void setup(){
        RC.begin();
        EEPROM.get(EEPROMADRESS, RC);
    }

If you want to use the EEPROM for your own needs, you can also change the adress to match your own code (don't forget to also change the adress in the calibration example) with the EEPROMADRESS definition (by default 0, so just writing/reading to/from the beginning of the EEPROM).
